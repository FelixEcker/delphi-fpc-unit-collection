# Delphi / FPC Unit Collection
This repository holds Units authored by myself which I use across multiple projects.
Not every Unit has the same license, due to them stemming from different projects,
instead they have their license within their source file.

The Makefile found in the root of this repository is not for compilation of this units,
rather it is a unspecialised Makefile I've created for freepascal projects.
